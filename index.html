  <h1>What is the objective of our game???</h1>
  <p>Currently in development the objective of the game is to not get caught by the poliece while you are at a party. Using used cans as amunition you have to keep
    the poliece at bay for as long as you can. For more health you can eat chicken rolls(30hp) and spice bags(50hp). You will have your "mates" with you and they can
    either be a distraction or they can help you along the way.<br/>
    Unfortunately we have not come up with a name for our game however feel free to let us know using the link below.</p>
