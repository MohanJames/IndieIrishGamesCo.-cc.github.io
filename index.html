  <p>In the Belvedere Roleplaying Society we play roleplaying bord games such as dungeons and dragons, werewolf, and many more. We meet every Thursday from 4pm - 6pm.
    We encourage anyone to come along and join, and we encourage people to act out as their character when in a game. This includes speaking out as their character, or
    doing actions in game that their character would do. In other words you could say its like acting without a script, but you know everything about the
  character that you are pretending to be.</p>
